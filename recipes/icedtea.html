        <p>Steps to create Iced-tea(lemon).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan pour 1.25 litres water.</li>
            <li>Heat the pan on a medium flame and let the water come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 2 tablespoons black tea powder. For a light tea taste, you can add 1 tablespoon tea powder. Instead of tea powder, you can also use black or green tea leaves.</li>
            <li>Add ⅓ to ½ cup sugar. For a less sweet taste, you can add ¼ cup sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix very well and let the tea leaves steep in the water for 4 to 5 minutes. For a lighter tea flavor, you can steep for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the tea is steeped in the hot water, then add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. For a more lemony taste, you can add 4 tablespoons of lemon juice also. You can also skip the lemon juice altogether and make a simple iced tea.</li>
            <li>Stir with a spoon.</li>
            <li> Then strain the tea in a steel or glass jar. The glass jar should be able to handle the heat.</li>
            <li>While serving, add 4 to 5 ice cubes in a glass. You can add less or more as per your preference. Also, add 1 to 2 lemon slices. Adding lemon slices is optional.</li>
        </ol>
